# 第1部分

# 介绍

Welcome to Express in Action. This is the first of three parts and, like many openers, it introduces the players.

欢迎来到Express实战。这是三大部分中的第一部分，就像许多开场白一样，介绍有哪些参与者。

In chapter 1, I’ll identify the characters. Spoiler alert: they are Node.js and
Express. The former is a JavaScript runtime—a place where JavaScript code can
run—that’s attractive to a lot of developers. Node.js is powerful, but its APIs can,
at times, lack power and leave you writing a lot of boilerplate code; that’s where
Express struts onto the scene. It fits snugly into Node.js and makes it easier to
write web applications. You’ll learn all this and much more in chapter 1.

在第1章，我会确定主要人物。剧透：它们是 Node.js和Express。 前者是一个JavaScript运行环境--一个JavaScript代码能够运行的地方--这对许多开发者来说具有吸引力。Node.js很强大，但是他的API有时显得很乏力，需要你写大量的样板代码；（基于上述情况）Express闪亮登场。它和Node.js无缝结合，使得Node能更加容易编写web应用。你将在第1章深入了解。

In chapter 2 you’ll learn what it means for Node.js to be a JavaScript runtime,
and you’ll be running JavaScript in Node.js. You’ll build a couple of simple modules and then see what it takes to build a website on the platform. You’ll also
learn how to include third-party modules from npm, Node.js’s third-party package registry.

在第2章，你将学习到Node.js作为一个JavaScript运行环境，到底是什么样子，然后你将在Node.js上运行JavaScript。

The star of the show, Express, takes center stage in chapter 3. You’ll see how
Express sits on top of Node.js, and learn its major features. Express will show you
convenience after convenience. We’ll delve deeper into each of these features in
subsequent chapters, but by the end of chapter 3, you’ll have all of the core
Express knowledge you’ll need.

I hope you are as excited as I to get started!
我希望你能像我一样兴奋地开始我们的学习！
